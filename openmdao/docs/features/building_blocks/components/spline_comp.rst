SplineComp
***************

SplineComp allows you to represent a large dimension variable as a smaller dimensional variable via
the various spline methods. This is useful for reducing the size of an optimization problem by
decreasing the number of design variables it solves. The spatial distribution of the points, in both
the original and interpolated spaces is typically uniform but other distributions can be used.


SplineComp Options

SplineComp Basic Example
-------------------------

In our example, we have a pre-generated curve that is described by `x_cp` and `y_cp` below which we
interpolate between. We also have pre-generated points to interpolate at, which in our case is: `x`.
To set the x position of control and interpolation points in `SplineComp` we pass `x_cp` and `x`
into their respective contstructor arguments (Figure 1). Next we'll add our `y_cp` data in by
calling the `add_spline` method and passing `y_cp` into the argument `y_cp_val` (Figure 2).
`SplineComp` calculates the `y_interp` values and gives the output of interpolated points
(Figure 3).

SplineComp Multiple Splines
---------------------------

`SplineComp` supports multiple splines on a fixed `xcp` grid. Below is an example of how a user can
setup two splines on a fixed grid. To do this the user needs to pass in names for `y_cp_name` and
`y_interp_name`, so they can be accessed, and the `y_cp_val` locations that make up the spline.

SplineComp Interpolation Distribution
-------------------------------------

We have included three different distribution functions for users to distribute their `x_input` data.
`cell_centered` takes the data passed in, along with the number points specified by the user, and finds
the midpoints of a linearly distributed array. Similar to `cell_centered`, `node_centered` takes the
data, number of points and creates a linearly distributed array. Finally, `sine_distribution`, taking
in the same arguments as others, also takes in a `phase` argument to allow for customization of the
distribution.

SplineComp Standalone
----------------------

Another included feature is a standalone version of `spline_comp`. This simple standalone function
is intended to be used for standard interpolation (StructuredMetaModel), including for
multidimensional data sets, and for constructing a higher dimension curve from a low dimensional
representation (SplineComp), as we use the spline components.
